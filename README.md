Original project: [denverquane/amonguscapture](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture)

## Installation

To set up modded Among Us with AutoMuteUs using this modified Capture version, follow these steps (very similar to the original setup):

1. [Invite](https://automute.us/) the official AutoMuteUs bot to your Discord server.
2. Install the latest version of the [Capture Software](https://github.com/automuteus/capture-install#readme) (this installs all necessary dependencies and the official AmongUsCapture.exe).
3. **Do not use the official AmongUsCapture.exe.**  
   Instead, download the latest version of the **modded AmongUsCapture** here:  
   <a href="https://github.com/Teg3z/amonguscapture/releases/latest/download/AmongUsCapture-Modded.zip" target="_blank">
    <img alt="GitHub release" src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Teg3z/amonguscapture?color=blue&label=Download%20Modded%20Capture&style=square">
   </a>
4. Extract the downloaded ZIP file and run the `AmongUsCapture-Modded.exe` inside it.
